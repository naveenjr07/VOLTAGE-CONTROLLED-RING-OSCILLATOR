# VOLTAGE-CONTROLLED-RING-OSCILLATOR
This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a CMOS-based Voltage-Controlled Ring Oscillator (VCO) implemented using Cadence Virtuoso. The oscillator is built using a ring of CMOS inverter stages, where the oscillation frequency is controlled by an external analog control voltage.
